ParseAndScore is implemented as a Console app.

Languages and Tools used:

MSSQL14 SQL Express
Dapper v 1.50.5
HtmlAgilityPack v 1.8.5

Step 1 - Install Nuget Packages

To install the nuget packages open the Package Manager Console window in Visual Studio run the command
nuget update ParseAndScore.sln 

This should auto install the nuget files listed above. If the command fails then select
the solution file from the Solution Explorer window, right click and select "Manage Nuget Packages for Solutions"
The nuget manager will open a new tab in Visual Studio. Under the browse option search for the listed nugets and install in 
the solution (including the test project)

Step 2 - Database Creation

A database creation script is included in the project in the folder "Creation Scripts".  
On an instance of MSSQL Sever run the attached script to recreate the database, tables and stored procedures

The ParseAndScore project and the ParseAndScoreTest project contain App.config settings 
that need to be modified with the version of SQL Sever in use specifically the value for "Server =". 

Please note: The "name=TestingDataBaseI" field should NOT be modified. 

<add name="TestingDatabaseI" connectionString="Server=.\SQLEXPRESS;Database=HtmlDatabase;Trusted_Connection=True;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/>

After running the Database creation script the unit tests in ParseAndScoreTest project should all pass.  The unit test includes calls to the database. Typically, unit testing 
the business logic would be separate from database connection test but the approach for this project is more end to end functional testing.
